# Swinging-Monkey
use algorithm to find and count all tree-pairs that monkey can jump to/over.


Consider a sequence of n trees { T0, T1, T2, T3, ..., Tn }. From T0, a monkey can swing to the next adjacent tree
(T1). It can also swing to other succeeding trees (T2 or T3 or ...) provided that the trees in the middle are shorter
than both T0 and the target tree. Suppose that tree heights = 10, 15, and 20 feet. The following are possible
pairs of trees that the monkey can swing
